Machine Learning projects of AI/ML Internship Program at InternPE.

1) Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Project aims to develop an accurate diabetes prediction system using Support Vector Machine algorithms and Python programming.
Support vector machine which classify the data with the help of hyperplane and find the maximum margin(space) that best separate the classes for an accurate prediction

Observations: A Patient whose glucose level is higher than 120 is highly susceptible to diabetes ( people with excessive consumption of sugar and higher insulin level).

2) CAR PRICE PREDICTION Project using Machine Learning technique, focusing on Linear Regression, and utilizing the dataset from Quikr Car.
Accurate prediction of price for used cars based on key features like model, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, and seller type.
IDE: Jupyter notebook
Programming Language: Python
Data Exploration & Preprocessing: l delved into the dataset, ensuring its cleanliness and handling missing values. l transformed categorical variables into numerical ones using innovative techniques like one-hot encoding and normalized numerical features for consistency.
Model Training & Evaluation: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, l trained our model using linear regression. This powerful algorithm learned the intricate relationships between input features and car prices. Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error and R-squared score validated our model's performance on unseen data.
Deployment & Predictions: With the model finely tuned, l deployed it to make real-time predictions on new data. Now, users can input car features and obtain instant estimates of their value, revolutionizing the used car market experience.

3) IPL WINNING TEAM PREDICTION Model Project
Platforms Used : Jupyter Notebook ,Visual Studio code
Developed a predictive model to estimate the probability of a team winning an IPL match based on various in-game parameters.
Utilized Streamlit for user-friendly python web application.
Implemented a Logistic Regression and Random Forest machine learning models from scikit-learn (sklearn) library for accurate prediction.

4) Project using neural networks for Breast Cancer Detection.
Develop and deploy a neural network model to assist in the early detection of breast cancer using mammogram images, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
Data Preprocessing: Collect and prepare a dataset of mammogram images, applying preprocessing techniques like normalization and augmentation.
Model Development: Design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, ensuring it generalizes well to new data.
